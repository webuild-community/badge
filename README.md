## Introduce to WeBuild badge

[WeBuild](https://webuild.community) is a community of Viet programmers. In WeBuild Slack, we chitchat, contribute to open source community and work on side projects. Over time, more and more products have been built by the community members, and they turn out to be a successful business.

We are proud to be a member of this community and love the way how we engage here. WeBuild helps connects us. That’s why we decide to make a badge for our community. Over hundreds of GitHub repositories were developed every year. And when pushed to GitHub, the badge shows your community the link to WeBuild, participated in the discussion, or joined one of the best community for makers.

We make the following badge to show others that we are from Vietnam, and we are also a member of this cool community. If you are a part of WeBuild Community, you can add the **WeBuild badge** to your repository, and it will help invite people to join us. More people is more fun.
